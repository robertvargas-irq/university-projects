// Program name: cargo.c
// Author:       Robert Vargas
// Date:         2/11/2021
// Purpose:      This program calculates the max weight that a
//               cargo ship can hold based on user-defined
//               input values for both the max weight that can
//               be held, and the individual weights of the subsequent
//               containers. Once the max weight is reached, the
//               program prints how many containers were able to fit the
//               cargo ship, the weight of all the containers, and the
//               max weight inputted by the user.

    float totalWeight;
    float loadedWeight;
    
    // take user input for the ship's max weight capacity
    printf("Please input the ship's total weight capacity (in Tons):\n");
    scanf("%f", &maxWeight);
    
    // take positive user input for each individual shipping container
    totalWeight = 0;
    loadedWeight = 0;
    containers = 0;
    while (totalWeight < maxWeight) {
        
        printf("Please input the weight of the shipping container (in Tons):\n");
        scanf("%f", &currentContainer);
        
        // checks for positive number
        if ( currentContainer > 0 ) {
            
            totalWeight += currentContainer;
            
            // set the real weight in the ship if it does not overflow
            if ( totalWeight <= maxWeight ) {
                
                loadedWeight = totalWeight;
