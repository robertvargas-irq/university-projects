## üå¥ <u>Spring 2022</u>
* <u><b>Compilers & Automata</u></b>
    + We will be building our own compiler using Lex and YACC, applying regular expressions and training Lex and YACC how to parse input, and define a specific ruleset for it to follow.
    <br>
    <sup>* Repo will be available at the end of the semester to avoid plaigarism.</sup>
* <u><b>Software Development</u></b>
    + We will be working in teams to create a software solution for any idea we wish, while also maintaining source control and a high level of testing and documentation.
    <br>
    <sup>* Repo will be available as soon as the project begins.</sup>

## üçÇ <u>Fall 2021</u>

* <u><b>[Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science](./Discrete%20Mathematics%20for%20CS)</u></b>
    + This class primarily focused on the __fundamentals of logic__, sets, permutations, and recursion with a heavy emphasis on __inductive proofs__.
* <u><b>[Intro to Data Structures](./Intro%20to%20Data%20Structures)</u></b>
    + This class went in-depth into different common data structures developers apply to solve a variety of different problems through software. This included, but was not limited to, Single and Doubly-Linked Lists, Generic Programming, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and a touch of AVL trees. Additionally, there was a heavy focus on runtime complexity, and analyzing algorithms.
